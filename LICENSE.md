## 1. Purpose and Scope

This licence governs the use of WFSL Cyber software designed exclusively for
evidence-only, condition-based cyber telemetry.

The Software provides:
- Deterministic network condition capture
- Stability and integrity scoring
- Evidence artefacts for audit, diagnostics, and trust assurance

The Software is not designed for surveillance and must not be used as such.

---

## 2. Grant of Licence

Wynergy Fibre Solutions Ltd (WFSL) grants the Licensee a non-exclusive,
non-transferable, revocable licence to:

- Use the Software internally
- Integrate the Software into enterprise systems
- Generate, store, and analyse evidence artefacts
- Verify infrastructure stability and integrity

This grant is subject to all restrictions in this licence.

---

## 2A. Convergence and Internal Integration

The Software may be integrated or converged with other WFSL-licensed software
components, including use as part of a composed WFSL platform, provided that:

- All components collectively remain within the constraints of this licence
- Integration does not enable prohibited activities
- Evidence-only operation is preserved across the full system

If any integrated component causes or enables a breach of this licence,
this licence terminates automatically.

---

## 3. Ownership and Intellectual Property

All intellectual property rights remain the exclusive property of WFSL.
No ownership rights are transferred under this licence.

---

## 4. Absolute Prohibitions

The Software must not be used, directly or indirectly, to perform or enable:

- Packet inspection or deep packet inspection
- Interception of communications
- Attribution of activity to identifiable individuals
- Behavioural profiling or intent inference
- MAC, device, RF, or BLE fingerprinting
- Signal triangulation or location inference
- Surveillance, monitoring, or tracking of persons

Any breach of this section immediately terminates this licence.

## 5. Compliance and Legal Posture

The Software is designed to operate below regulatory surveillance thresholds.
The Licensee is responsible for lawful use.

WFSL accepts no liability for misuse or extension beyond this licence.

---

## 6. Evidence-Only Constraint

All outputs are technical, condition-based evidence artefacts.

Outputs must not be combined with other data sources to infer identity,
behaviour, intent, or location.

This restriction applies to both standalone use and converged WFSL platforms.

---

## 7. Audit and Verification

Baseline artefacts and hashes define canonical behaviour.
Any modification requires explicit governance approval.

---

## 8. Termination

This licence terminates immediately upon any breach of its terms.
All use of the Software must cease upon termination.

---

## 9. No Warranty

The Software is provided "as is", without warranty of any kind.
